h1 About Me

p I'm Matthew Salt, I write software for a living and also for fun. For my day job I wwork on a dsitributed trading application for Citi, mostly using java. At home I play around with whatever interests me. At the moment that is Javascript and Swift.

h4 A brief overview

p I started really programming at university using Fortran for simulations and modelling. After univeristy I started working at JHC, a small financial software company specialising in asset managmenet software. I started off with RPG programming on the as/400. While working on this I was dabbling in Java on the side. I  figured that this would be a more interesting language to work in so I applied for a job in one of the teams using java at JHC. 

p My next move was to Commerzbank AG where I worked on a fixed income etrading system. After a couple of years there I decided it was time to move on and I got my current job as a software developer at citi helping to redesign there Index CDS trading platform. 

P I've tinkered with different things at home. I started by looking at arduino microcontrollers and then moved on to raspberry pis and python. In the last year or so I've been looking at node.js and Swift. You cna find some examples on my projects page or on github

p Whenever I can I like to get out of the Citi and into the countryside. On a summer evening you'll sometimes find me on a hill near London in a bivvy bag! I'm slowly working my way through the UK's national trails and in 2015 a friend and I decided to row from Lechlade to Putney. I'm always looking for the next challenge whether it's tech related or outdoors.
